            From a total of 300,000 tons of coffee, Ethiopia’s total export earnings
             for the 2021/22 fiscal year ended with a record of 1.4 billion USD. In the
              first quarter of the current fiscal year alone, an export earning of over 
              $ 420 million has been reported. From such figures, one can presume the hard

            <p>Ethiopia has produced some of the most extraordinary coffees in the world since its discovery
               eons ago. Ethiopia is widely recognized as the birthplace of coffee, and among coffee connoisseurs,
                the tale of a goat herder, a monk, and errant goats is almost as well-known as coffee itself. 
                The biggest producer of coffee in Africa today, Ethiopia, is thought to have been exporting 
                coffee as early as the 17th century, though the trade didn't take off until the 19th century.
                 The value of coffee to the economy of the nation today cannot be overstated.
                 <br><br>

              Ethiopia is heavily dependent on coffee as a primary source of income: it accounts for close
               to 70% of all export revenues. An estimated 15 million Ethiopians are employed in the coffee
                industry. Ethiopia uses three different "production systems" for coffee: Forest Coffees, where
                 locals harvest coffee that has grown wild; Garden Coffees, grown in small holder plots (typically
                  measured in terms of trees rather than hectares); and Plantation Coffees, which make up a very small
                   portion of Ethiopian coffee and are grown on vast estates. The Garden Coffee System is used to generate
                    the great majority of the nation's coffee. Wet processing and sun-drying are the two most common methods 
                    for processing coffee. Currently, only 20–30% of Ethiopian coffee is washed, with the remaining 70–80% 
                    being sun- or no-washed. Ethiopians are among the continent's biggest coffee drinkers, and the 
              coffee trend there is steadily expanding. Domestic consumption accounts for about half of the nation's coffee
               production.</p>

          <p>A <span>15-year</span> coffee development strategy was recently introduced by the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority (ECTA),
             according to officials, and it will be crucial to optimizing the nation's coffee production capability. 
             The COVID-19 epidemic delayed the introduction of the plan, which was created in cooperation with the Ethiopian 
             Institute of Agriculture Research (EIAR) and the international NGO TechnoServe, by more than two years. It points
              out prospects along the entire coffee value chain to significantly enhance the nation's exports of high-quality,
               environmentally friendly coffee, boosting farmer incomes and generating jobs for millions of people. The Coffee
                Strategy, which will be in effect until 2033, is built on six major pillars and intends to assist in the creation
                 of a long-term, common vision among the sector's major players. 
            These include processing, value-adding, marketing, value-added extension services, research, and sector
             strengthening.</p>

          <p>The minimum coffee pricing directive was a new regulation that the Ethiopian Tea & Coffee Association issued to the market. The regulation obliges Ethiopian coffee exporters to sell their product at a minimum price or more. The weekly minimum pricing is broken down by location, grade, and exporter type.
